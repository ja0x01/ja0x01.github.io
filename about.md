<b>$ cat about.txt</b>

My journey into the tech world started around 13 years ago. It all began with something very innocent: playing games with my dad on the good old PS2. But one day, the magic stopped — the game CDs started failing, and I couldn't keep creating the most random team combos in _Marvel Ultimate Alliance_. Desperate to fix this, I went down the rabbit hole of learning how to recover or replace PS2 DVDs. Turns out, downloading and burning new discs was the way to go — and somehow, little 9-year-old me made it happen, even without much content available in Portuguese at the time.

The funny part? The moment I figured out how to do that, playing the games became boring. All I wanted was to mess around on the computer. I spent hours watching YouTube tutorials on game development. I had zero clue what those lines of code meant, but copying and pasting into Unity and watching something _work_ felt like magic.

Not long after, a friend showed me a "trick" to take over Facebook accounts from people who hadn’t set up their phone numbers. We’d request password resets to our own numbers and — boom — log into their accounts. Of course, we only did it to post silly stuff and laugh (sorry, friends!). From there, I dove headfirst into script kiddie territory: running exploits I didn’t fully understand, cracking software (mostly _The Sims 3_ expansions for my brother), and living on the edge — until the day Avast screamed that our family PC had a Trojan. Panic. Full panic. I didn’t even know what a Trojan _was_. After wiping the computer and reinstalling Windows, curiosity took over. I started reading about malware, and the idea of having that level of access to someone else’s computer felt like wizardry. But it also scared the hell out of me, so I stepped away from the "dark side".

Fast forward a few years, my mother-in-law insisted I should go to university, so I enrolled in Software Engineering at UNOESTE. In high school, I was always “the smart guy” — the one who barely studied but got by. At university, my curiosity really kicked in. I couldn’t just accept _what_ things were; I needed to understand _how_ they worked. “Okay, that’s how you query a database — but how does the database itself work?” That attitude helped me a lot, and soon I found myself learning more on my own than in class. Unfortunately, financial reasons forced me to drop out — but by then, I had already landed my first job as a backend PHP developer.

That’s where everything clicked. I was finally applying everything I’d learned, and constantly pushing to improve the security of the products we were building. I was _that guy_ who would sneak a little pentest (unofficial, of course) during code review just for fun. One day, they invited me to give a talk about application security at an internal company event — I spoke about the developer’s role in securing applications. A few months later, I was offered a role as an Information Security Analyst.

That job took me way beyond appsec. I worked with security policies, hardening servers, setting up and maintaining WAF, XDR, SIEM, IDS/IPS solutions, and more. I got my hands dirty automating CI/CD pipelines, doing secure code reviews, and building security into every part of the dev process. I became a huge DevSecOps enthusiast — it’s my favorite playground.

And somewhere along the way, I fell in love with Linux. I’ve spent countless hours tweaking systems, managing servers, and understanding infrastructure from the ground up. Before becoming a security analyst, I was always the dev who wanted to understand _why_ the deployment broke, how containers worked under the hood, and how to make things more robust and secure. Infrastructure and automation became a big part of my daily life — and still are.

But my curiosity doesn’t stop. In 2024, I decided to take this passion even further and joined a federal university to study Mechatronics — a field that brings together mechanics, electronics, and computing. It’s been the perfect way to dive deeper into hardware development and explore something I’ve always been fascinated by: hardware hacking. Learning how things work not only in code but also at the electrical and physical level feels like leveling up that same curiosity I’ve had since day one.

Today, I keep building, learning, breaking, fixing, and sharing. And I still think back to that kid trying to save his PS2 games, not knowing he’d end up here — having just as much fun, but with way cooler toys.
